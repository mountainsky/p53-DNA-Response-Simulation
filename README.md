# p53-Response-Simulation
Using python to model the response of tumor-suppressing p53 and related proteins following DNA damage to best model the real life response and provide insights for possible cancer treatments.  

The code provides various alternative models for p53, Wip1, and other associated proteins using ODE's. These models include negative-feedback, negative and positive feedback, and spatial models, with the extended spatial model being the same as the regular spatial one, but showing the effect that a Wip1-inhibiting drug may have on the system. 

Please refer to "ODE-Spatial-Model_extended.py" for the primary code model, and "p53 Response Report.pdf" for the full summary of our work.
